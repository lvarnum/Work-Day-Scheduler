# Work Day Scheduler
The application works as a daily planner for the user. The date is displayed at the top of the page and the hour blocks 9 AM - 5 PM are displayed below. The user is able to input and change events in current (red) or future (green) timeblocks. Gray blocks represent past time and events. If the user clicks on the save button, the inputted event for that timeblock will be saved and displayed on reload.
